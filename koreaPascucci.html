                        'Monte Cerignone' in central Italy is a place where the Pascucci family has kept
                        green beans for a long time, and it is a place like a natural fortress where constant
                        temperature and low humidity are maintained throughout the year. The micro-
                        climate of 600m in the valley of the Conga River allows green beans to maintain
                        their unique flavor and naturally mature over time, so it is deeper than the state-of

                        Arabica and 20% Robusta through expert testing. The reason why the Pascucci
                        family uses Robusta for blending comes from Italian coffee culture, the home of
                        espresso. In Italy, there has long been a preference for blending Robusta with
                        Arabica to give espresso its heavy body and deep bitterness. The blending know-
                        how of the Pascucci family is to express the aromatic and heavy body of Robusta
                        with the acidity and rich taste and aroma of Arabica. Also, due to the use of quality
                        Robusta species, stable extraction and unique golden crema can be enjoyed for a

                        roasting. Slow roasting is a method of slowly roasting at medium heat for 15 to 18
                        minutes, which is longer than the normal roasting time of 11 to 14 minutes, to
                        naturally evaporate the moisture in green beans and to bring out the good taste

                        </b>
                        After the Pascucci family started trading green beans in 1883 and established a
                        roasting factory that served as a stepping stone for the spread of the coffee
                        industry, research on Italian espresso began actively. At first, it was simply a study
                        on green coffee beans, but later, in order to strengthen the quality of espresso, we
                        established our own research institute operated by a group of experts such as
                        agronomists and scientists, and continued quality control at the production site
                        through history of each green coffee bean, standard management of defective
                        coffee beans, and research on mold and pests. It has expanded into research that
                        enables the production of good green coffee beans. Through this, we provide
                        various information to producers with poor research environments and support
                        them to maintain sustainable quality. Pascucci is able to maintain the unchanging
                        taste of espresso for 130 years through continuous research and sharing of
                        information, and is creating a sustainable coffee industry with the production area.
